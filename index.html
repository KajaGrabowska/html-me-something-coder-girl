                <h2 id = "hawaii">Hawaii</h2>
                <p>It's my and my husband's dream to go to Hawaii. We both love the ocean, being on the beach, and the tropical vibe. We also love the fact that there is always the same warm temperature there. And of course Hawaii is absolutely beautiful! We are hoping to go there in the next couple of years.</p>

                <h2 id = "italy">Italy</h2>
                <p>I have always wanted to go to Italy. Italian food is my absolute favorite food, I love the architecture, the culture, the scenery, etc. Some of my favorite movies are movies that take place in Italy, like <em>Under the Tuscan Sun</em> or <em>Letters to Juliet</em>. I don't know when I'll be able to go there but it's definitely on my bucket list.</p>

                <h2 id = "paris">Paris</h2>
                <p>Another place I have always wanted to visit is Paris. I studied French in high school for three years and I even picked French as one of my high school exit exam subjects. What I love the most about Paris, and France in general, is their sophisticated culture and... baked goods! I love baking, it's my hobby and I absolutely adore eating pastries of any kind so I would love to go to Paris and tour bakeries and patisseries.</p>

                <h2 id = "spain">Spain</h2>
                <p>In Spain I'd like to see Barcelona and Madrid, as well as some other coastal cities. The main reason I wanna go there is to practice my Spanish, which I studied in college, and to eat local food and admire the architecture.</p>

                <h2 id = "greece">Greece</h2>
                <p>Greece is known for being the cradle of Western Civilization, the birthplace of democracy, the Olympic Games, and its ancient history and magnificent temples. Ancient temples in Greece include the Parthenon at the Acropolis in Athens, the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, and the Temple of Poseidon at Sounion. I have always been interested in ancient civilizations so I would love to see the Greek monuments. I also love the white houses typical of Greek architecture. This would be an awesome trip!</p>

                <h2 id = "japan">Japan</h2>
                <p>Japan is known worldwide for its traditional arts, including tea ceremonies, calligraphy and flower arranging. The country has a legacy of distinctive gardens, sculpture and poetry. Japan is home to more than a dozen UNESCO World Heritage sites and is the birthplace of sushi, one of its most famous culinary exports. I love Japanese architecture, Japanese gardens, and tea, so I would love to go there and see all these beatiful places in person.</p>

                <p>Widely known for its exceptional natural beauty and considered one of the world's most visually powerful landscapes, the Grand Canyon is celebrated for its plunging depths; temple-like buttes; and vast, multihued, labyrinthine topography. Scenic wonders within park boundaries include high plateaus, plains, deserts, forests, cinder cones, lava flows, streams, waterfalls, and one of America’s great whitewater rivers.</p>
